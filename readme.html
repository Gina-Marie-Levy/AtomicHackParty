<p>Ok, this is the notes on what I'm doing so far.</p>
<p>My idea is an web app where people can go and see where people reported skimmers. And had their information stolen.</p>

<p>Basic bare-bones idea.</p>
<p>So far I want my basic title on the page</p>
<p>the subtitle to draw people in.</p>
Then I want a short, brief about section or page or both. I haven't decided yet.</p>
<p>Then I want my basic posting section area where people can view what they posted and make comments.</p>
<p> Maybe a realtime chat area or not.</p>
<p>Then I want a contact me page in case something goes wrong or on the bottom of the comment section.</p>
<p> A footer bar with copyright info of course.</p>
